## Problem Statement

The rental market suffers from a critical **trust deficit** around **security deposits**:

- **Centralized control**: Traditional platforms give owners full authority over deposits, leaving renters vulnerable
- **No transparency**: Renters have no visibility into what happens to their money
- **Broken promises**: Many platforms either skip deposits entirely (risking owner assets) or hold them centrally with zero guarantees of fair release
- **Dispute nightmares**: When disagreements arise, there's no impartial arbiter‚Äîjust he-said-she-said chaos

The result? Renters hesitate to pay deposits, and owners hesitate to rent without them. Everyone loses.

---

## Solution

**BlokRentals** revolutionizes day-to-day rentals by **locking deposits in blockchain escrow** where neither party can access the funds until both are satisfied.

Built on **Concordium smart contracts**, BlokRent ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Zero unilateral control** ‚Äì deposits are cryptographically secured on-chain
- ‚úÖ **Transparent release conditions** ‚Äì both parties must confirm, or auto-release triggers after return
- ‚úÖ **Trustless arbitration** ‚Äì smart contracts enforce the rules, not humans
- ‚úÖ **Automatic refunds** ‚Äì if the owner doesn't act after item return, funds auto-release to the renter

No middleman. No hidden fees. Just pure, auditable trust.
